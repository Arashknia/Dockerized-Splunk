# Dockerized-Splunk
This is made to install Splunk on the docker environment and configure your own Splunk to have logs from your own PC or other sources for training purposes and preparation for real-world organization scenarios.  (This is not with the data-input feature in Splunk nor with the cloud).

beware! you have to enable your virtualization feature in your motherboard bios setting to get the docker to work correctly
