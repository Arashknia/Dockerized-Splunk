# Dockerized-Splunk
This is made to install Splunk on the docker environment and configure your own or other Splunk logs for training purposes and preparation for real-world organization scenarios.  (This is not with the data-input feature in Splunk nor with the cloud).

beware! you have to enable your virtualization feature in your bios setting to get the docker to work correctly
