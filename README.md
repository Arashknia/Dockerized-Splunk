# Dockerized-Splunk
---

This is made to install Splunk in the Docker environment and configure your own Splunk to have logs from your PC or other sources for training purposes or preparation for real-world organization scenarios.  (This is not with the data-input feature in Splunk nor with the cloud).

beware! You have to enable your virtualization feature in your motherboard BIOS settings to get Docker to work correctly. If your motherboard doesn't have this feature, then please use Alt + F4 ASAP, and don't waste your time!!! :)))

This Splunk implementation of ours is a single node/instance! This means the indexer and search head will be deployed in one place (Docker container).
